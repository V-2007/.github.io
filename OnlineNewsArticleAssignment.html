        <p> New cat cafe called <b>Cat-fé</b> is opening, so get ready to go to your new favorite café of the town. Even the mayor would agree with you!</p>

        <blockquote><q> This is <em>literally</em> the best café of my town, by the way I am the owner of it. </q>

        </blockquote>

        <p>But you may ask: <q>Just <em>why</em>, why would this even be my favorite café of the town?</q>
        Good question! There are two reasons:</p>

        <h3> 1) It has coffee </h3>
        <p> Would you go to a café that doesn't have coffee?</p>

        <hr/>

        <h3> 2) It has cats </h3>
            <p> Drinking coffee with cats over you is evidently a momentous experience.</p>

            <hr/>

        <p><small><del>1 coffee costs 100$ dollars (no returns, <em>please</em>)</del></small></p>

        <p> So come today to Cat-fé, your appropiate place to enjoy a extravagant afternoon (<em>with</em> cats)!</p>
